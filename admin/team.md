### **TA: Gagan Gopalaiah**


### **Team Lead: Rhea Bhutada**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Rhea Bhutada and I am currently a CS major and CogSci minor at ERC. The intersection between neuroscience and computer science really fascinates me and I generally try to apply myself to projects that deal with the overlap of both of these fields. This year I'm working as an undergraduate researcher at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, which has been an extremely cool experience. Other than that I love to stay active. I used to play basketball in high school and was in an NCAA commercial with Shaq. But lately, I’ve been really into running. Overall, I'm excited to contribute to this project! Although I haven't had too much industry experience, I am interested to see how I can apply my previous course work to backend or frontend design.

### **Gavyn Ezell**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Gavyn Ezell and I’m from Hawaii. Currently a 3rd year CS Major at Muir. I love video games, playing piano, and going to the gym. For SWE, backend interests me most (I am not good with design and visuals), and I’m hoping to learn a lot more backend from this project!

### **Daniel Hernandez**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Daniel Hernandez and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major and music minor. Some of my interests in the CS field are ML, AI, and Cybersecurity. Outside of school, I play drums for a local band. For SE, the backend aspect appeals to me the most since I am able to utilize more of what I learned from my past classes. However, I would want to try frontend since I do enjoy design to some extent.

- #### About Me:
  - My name is Arthur Lu and I am a 3rd year CE major. I am primarily interested in low level systems design, hardware development and optimization, and HPC architecture. I work as an undergraduate research assistant for Prof. Turakhia developing hardware accelerators for long length genome alignment. When I’m not busy, I like to relax with some retro video games.
