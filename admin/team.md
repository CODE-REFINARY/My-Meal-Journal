### **TA: Gagan Gopalaiah**


### **Team Lead: Rhea Bhutada**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Rhea Bhutada and I am currently a CS major and CogSci minor at ERC. The intersection between neuroscience and computer science really fascinates me and I generally try to apply myself to projects that deal with the overlap of both of these fields. This year I'm working as an undergraduate researcher at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, which has been an extremely cool experience. Other than that I love to stay active. I used to play basketball in high school and was in an NCAA commercial with Shaq. But lately, I’ve been really into running. Overall, I'm excited to contribute to this project! Although I haven't had too much industry experience, I am interested to see how I can apply my previous course work to backend or frontend design.

### **Team Lead: George Dubinin**
- #### About Me:
   - Hello World! I'm the second lead on this project and I'm super excited to share my experience as a fifth year (super senior!) computer science major. My technical interests include virtualization and IaC (infrastructure as code) particularly as they relate to web development. In addition I've studied computer hardware design, cryptography, and cybersecurity which I explored while interning at Palo Alto Networks during Summer 2022. I am also deeply passionate about music and I am the current training manager for DVC, the on-campus DJ club. This quarter is going to be a fantastic opportunitity to work with the team and learn from all the amazing experience that our members are bringing!

### **Gavyn Ezell**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Gavyn Ezell and I’m from Hawaii. Currently a 3rd year CS Major at Muir. I love video games, playing piano, and going to the gym. For SWE, backend interests me most (I am not good with design and visuals), and I’m hoping to learn a lot more backend from this project!

### **Daniel Hernandez**
- #### About Me: 
  - My name is Daniel Hernandez and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major and music minor. Some of my interests in the CS field are ML, AI, and Cybersecurity. Outside of school, I play drums for a local band. For SE, the backend aspect appeals to me the most since I am able to utilize more of what I learned from my past classes. However, I would want to try frontend since I do enjoy design to some extent.
